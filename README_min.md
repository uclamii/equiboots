The `equiboots` library is a fairness-aware model evaluation toolkit designed to audit performance disparities across demographic groups. It provides robust, bootstrapped metrics for binary, multi-class, and multi-label classification, as well as regression models. The library supports group-wise performance slicing, fairness diagnostics, and customizable visualizations to support equitable AI/ML development.

`equiboots` is particularly useful in clinical, social, and policy domains where transparency, bias mitigation, and outcome fairness are critical for responsible deployment.
