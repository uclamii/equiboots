The `equiboots` library is a fairness-aware model evaluation toolkit designed to audit performance disparities across demographic groups. It provides robust, bootstrapped metrics for binary, multi-class, and multi-label classification, as well as regression models. The library supports group-wise performance slicing, fairness diagnostics, and customizable visualizations to support equitable AI/ML development.

`equiboots` is particularly useful in clinical, social, and policy domains where transparency, bias mitigation, and outcome fairness are critical for responsible deployment.

# StatisticalTester

The `StatisticalTester` class provides a comprehensive suite of statistical tests for analyzing differences between groups in machine learning metrics. It supports various statistical tests and multiple comparison adjustments.

## Features

- Multiple statistical test implementations
- Support for different types of data (continuous, discrete)
- Multiple comparison adjustments
- Effect size calculations
- Confidence interval estimation
- Flexible configuration options
- Support for both reference group and all-group comparisons

## Available Statistical Tests

1. **Mann-Whitney U Test**
   - Non-parametric test for comparing two independent samples
   - Suitable for ordinal or continuous data
   - Robust to non-normal distributions
   - Effect size: Rank-biserial correlation

2. **Welch's t-test**
   - Parametric test for comparing two independent samples
   - Handles unequal variances
   - Assumes approximately normal distributions
   - Effect size: Cohen's d
   - Confidence intervals: Parametric

3. **Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test**
   - Non-parametric test for comparing distributions
   - Tests for differences in shape and location
   - Suitable for continuous data
   - Effect size: Maximum distance between CDFs

4. **Permutation Test**
   - Non-parametric test using resampling
   - Makes minimal assumptions about data distribution
   - Provides confidence intervals from null distribution
   - Effect size: Mean difference
   - Confidence intervals: Bootstrap-based

5. **Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test**
   - Non-parametric test for paired samples
   - Suitable for ordinal or continuous data
   - Handles non-normal distributions
   - Effect size: Rank-biserial correlation

## Multiple Comparison Adjustments

1. **Bonferroni Correction**
   - Conservative adjustment method
   - Controls family-wise error rate
   - Suitable for small number of comparisons

2. **Benjamini-Hochberg FDR**
   - Less conservative than Bonferroni
   - Controls false discovery rate
   - Suitable for large number of comparisons

3. **Holm-Bonferroni Method**
   - Step-down procedure
   - More powerful than Bonferroni
   - Controls family-wise error rate

## Usage Examples

### Reference Group Comparison
```python
from equiboots.StatisticalTester import StatisticalTester

# Initialize the tester
tester = StatisticalTester()

# Example data
metrics_data = {
    'group1': {'metric1': 0.8, 'metric2': 0.6},
    'group2': {'metric1': 0.9, 'metric2': 0.7},
    'group3': {'metric1': 0.85, 'metric2': 0.65}
}

# Perform tests against reference group
results = tester.analyze_metrics(
    metrics_data,
    reference_group='group1',
    test_config={
        "test_type": "permutation",
        "alpha": 0.05,
        "bootstrap_iterations": 1000,
        "confidence_level": 0.95
    }
)
```

### All Group Comparisons
```python
# Perform tests between all groups
all_results = tester.analyze_all_group_comparisons(
    metrics_data,
    test_config={
        "test_type": "mann_whitney",
        "alpha": 0.05,
        "adjust_method": "bonferroni"  # Important for multiple comparisons
    }
)

# Access results for specific group pair
group1_vs_group2 = all_results['group1']['group2']
print(f"Metric1 comparison: {group1_vs_group2['metric1'].p_value}")
```

## Configuration Options

The statistical tests accept a configuration dictionary with the following options:

```python
config = {
    "test_type": "permutation",       # Type of test to perform
    "alpha": 0.05,                    # Significance level
    "alternative": "two-sided",       # Alternative hypothesis
    "bootstrap_iterations": 1000,     # Number of bootstrap samples
    "confidence_level": 0.95,         # Confidence level for intervals
    "adjust_method": "none",          # Multiple comparison adjustment
}
```

## Effect Size Measures

- Cohen's d for parametric tests
- Rank-biserial correlation for non-parametric tests
- Maximum distance between CDFs for KS test
- Mean difference for permutation test

## Confidence Intervals

- Bootstrap-based confidence intervals for permutation tests
- Parametric confidence intervals for t-tests
- Null distribution-based intervals for permutation tests

## Best Practices

1. **Test Selection**
   - Use parametric tests for normally distributed data
   - Use non-parametric tests for skewed or ordinal data
   - Consider sample size when choosing tests
   - Use permutation tests for robust comparisons

2. **Multiple Comparisons**
   - Use appropriate adjustment methods based on the number of comparisons
   - Consider the trade-off between power and type I error control
   - Document the adjustment method used
   - When comparing all groups, use more conservative adjustments (e.g., Bonferroni)

3. **Effect Size Interpretation**
   - Report effect sizes along with p-values
   - Use standardized effect sizes for comparability
   - Consider practical significance alongside statistical significance

4. **Assumptions**
   - Check test assumptions before application
   - Use robust tests when assumptions are violated
   - Document any deviations from standard assumptions

5. **All-Group Comparisons**
   - Use when you need to understand relationships between all groups
   - Be aware of increased multiple comparison burden
   - Consider using more conservative alpha levels
   - Document all significant findings, not just those against reference
